						<p>The principle behind the credit piggybacking system of authorized user tradelines is quite easy in theory. What happens is that you attach individuals as authorized users to credit cards that have a flawless payment history, so that the good report of those credit cards is reckoned as belonging to the authorized user, thus increasing their credit scores. </p>
						<p>However, things can get a bit complicated when you consider the uniqueness of the credit reports belonging to the individual being added. This is why, whether you are buying or selling authorized user tradelines, you need a professional to guide you along the way. </p>
						<p>This is also why we&#x2019;ve dedicated two FAQ pages to further explain the process, specifically in answer to the most common questions asked by our clients concerning authorized user trade lines.</p>
						<p>You are currently on the FAQs page for those seeking to buy tradelines to restore their credit score. To visit the page for those seeking to sell tradelines, click below link:</p>

						<p>FAQs for Sellers</p>
						 
						<p>This page dedicated to tradeline buyers may not answer all of your questions. If you have any other questions different from what we&#x2019;ve treated here, please see our other Tradelines/Credit Resources categories or contact us using the link at the end of this page.</p>

						        <p>A &#x201C;tradeline&#x201D; is simply a credit account. So, typically any of your credit cards (for instance your mortgage or student loan or car note) is considered to be a tradeline on your credit report.</p>
								<p>An authorized user tradeline is specifically an authorized user (AU) credit account. </p>
								<p>Authorized user tradelines are accounts in which you occupy positions on someone &#x2019;s credit card because that someone added you as an authorized user to their credit card that has a perfect payment record.</p>
								<p>The greatest benefit you stand to gain from this is that the tradeline directly and positively affects your credit score. How? This someone&#x2019;s full credit history with perfect payment records and low utilization rate is added to your credit score.</p>
								<p>This is called &#x201C;credit piggybacking&#x201D;.</p>
								<p>This helps you build credit faster so that you can qualify for an auto loan, or a mortgage or the refinancing of an existing loan.</p>

						        <p>The term &#x201C;seasoned&#x201D; suggests that something or someone has become more valuable with time. </p>
								<p>Therefore, a seasoned tradeline is a credit account that has been in operation for a long period and has maintained a low utilization rate and faultless payment history throughout that long period. </p>
								<p>If an account is below two years old, it would not be considered to be seasoned. For a tradeline to qualify as seasoned, it must be a minimum of two years and above.</p>
								<p>The older a tradeline is, the more seasoned it is regarded to be. It follows then that the more seasoned a tradeline is, the better it will be at helping you to restore and build your credit.</p>

						        <p>The health of your credit affects every facet of your financial, legal and cooperate life because it is such an integral part of the United States financial system and your records as an individual. </p>
								<p>Credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) are privately owned credit reporting agencies that each prepare a separate detailed report on your credit history known as a credit report. </p>
								<p>Your credit report contains a list of all your credit accounts (past and current), your credit history (positive or negative) and other related identifying information. Your credit report is a legal entitlement and is free for you to obtain from the bureaus.</p>
								<p>A credit score, on the other hand, is calculated based on the information on your credit report. A credit score is essentially your credit report summarized into a 3-digit rating that translates into your creditworthiness and tells how likely you are to breach the terms and conditions of a loan (also known as &#x201C;defaulting a loan&#x201D;).</p>
								<p>The VantageScore (primarily for educational purposes) and the FICO credit score (primarily for lenders) are the two major versions of credit scores available. Both of them have ratings that range from 300 to the highest score of 850.</p>
								<p>A high credit score is considered good credit, and this means you are less likely to default on a loan. A low credit score is considered bad credit, and this means you are more than likely to default on a loan.</p>

						        <p>Most people who come to us have credit files that are fairly complex because of the depth of their credit history. </p>
								<p>Are your credit files like that? Not to worry! All the more reason for you to buy seasoned tradelines from only a reliable and well-reputed tradeline company.</p>
								<p>And that&#x2019;s where we come in. There is hardly a general rule as to how people should buy tradelines (since every person&#x2019;s credit history is unique), except that two main variables determine whether or not you should buy a tradeline:</p>
								<ul>
								<li><p>the credit limit of the tradeline; </p></li>
								<li><p>the age of the tradeline. </p></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Other factors determine whether the chosen tradeline is a good buy or not. However, it&#x2019;s more than just about buying aged tradelines with a good credit limit and at a cheap price. </p>
								<p>In choosing the best tradelines for your peculiar situation, our professional credit designers will, first of all, take a look at your credit history. We will then help you understand what is contained in your credit file and how adding seasoned tradelines will affect the important factors and data points in your files.</p>

						        <p>The age of a card and the credit limit are the two major variables that determine how the said card will impact your credit score. Both variables correlate to yield bigger credit score increases in a short time.</p>
								<p>However, it is our guided opinion that age is the more important of these two factors. Let&#x2019;s take an instance.</p>
								<p>Your credit score is categorized as follows:</p>
								<ul>
								<li><p>your payment history = 35%</p></li>
								<li><p>how much you owe = 30%</p></li>
								<li><p>length of credit history = 15%</p></li>
								<li><p>credit mix = 10%</p></li>
								<li><p>new credit = 10%</p></li>
								</ul>
								<p>Utilization ratios belong under the &#x201C;how much you owe&#x201D; category, which makes up about 30% of your score.</p>
								<p>A high credit limit tradeline can be useful in helping you lower your overall utilization ratio. But if you have multiple high-utilization credit cards, that will serve as a negative factor that works against the high credit limit tradeline. In such a case, choosing high credit limit tradelines won&#x2019;t even cover the full 30% of that category. If you&#x2019;re lucky, maybe 10-15% will be covered.</p>
								<p>If you choose tradelines with both a long and perfect payment history (which accounts for the &#x201C;your payment history = 35%&#x201D; category and the &#x201C;length of credit history = 15%&#x201D; category) you stand to improve your credit score a whole lot faster and by a greater percentage.</p>
								<p>Add the two categories together, and that accounts for about 50% of a credit score, the two categories both being impacted by the age of the tradelines alone.</p>
								<p>This is why we only offer &#x201C;seasoned&#x201D; tradelines to our clients. </p>
								<p>Again, please bear in mind that every client&#x2019;s credit file is unique and therefore every person&#x2019;s solution needs to be tailored specifically to suit their particular situation. To speak with our credit specialists first.</p>

						        <p>Once our company adds you to an account, you will remain an active authorized user for a minimum of two posting/reporting cycles (that is approximately two consecutive months or 60 days). The tradeline will be reported as an open account throughout this active period.</p>
								<p>Upon the expiration of this period as an active authorized user, your lease also expires and you will be removed from that account. </p>
								<p>Usually, the account will remain on your credit report and will be seen as part of your permanent credit history, making your credit report even more solid. However, the status of that tradeline will henceforth appear as a closed account based on your current terminated authorized user status. </p>
								<p>Tradelines are more of a short-term strategy with great long-term benefits. Still, open accounts typically yield better leverage than closed accounts.</p>
								<p>Please note that closed accounts will have a diminishing impact and leave a dip on your account as time goes on. We have seen instances of this. This is so because the credit bureaus attach greater significance to the recentness of events on your credit record.</p>
								<p>In light of this, if you wish to extend your tradeline for an additional period, please use the link at the bottom of this page to get in touch with us for the pricing and paperwork before your lease expires, so that we can keep you on the primary user&#x2019;s account for longer. </p>

						        <p>Piggybacking Credit using authorized user tradelines is legal and is common practice. A study conducted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) revealed that nearly 25% of all the credit files in the American population established their credit through some form of piggybacking from the initial.</p>
								<p>Piggybacking Credit using authorized user tradelines is also protected by the provisions in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 – Regulation B, in which ECOA prohibits FICO from discriminating on the basis of marital status, and demands that all authorized user accounts be equally considered, whether the authorized user be a spouse or not. </p>
