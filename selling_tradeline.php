						            <h4 class="mt-2">How It Works</h4>
						            <p>Traditionally, it is companies that sell tradelines, and not stand-alone individuals. </p>
									<p>The reason why tradeline broker companies like Credit Rental are invaluable is that finding consumers with perfect credit that are willing to be credit partners (someone who gets paid for the right to temporarily add someone else as an authorized user (AU) on their credit cards) is time-consuming for consumers with insufficient credit. Likewise,  finding and marketing to consumers with insufficient credit who are willing to buy tradelines is also time-consuming.</p>
									<p>Credit Rental does all the hard work. We attract consumers who are looking to improve their credit scores. We also make available a pool of people with an impeccable credit history who are willing (at a price) to help those with bad credit seeking improvement. </p>
									<p>We&#x2019;ve broken down this process into steps below for easier assimilation.</p>
									<ul>
									<li><p>You register and sign an agreement with the company and you become a credit partner. </p></li>
									<li><p>You choose the credit cards on which you wish to sell tradelines and the company lists the tradelines in their inventory. </p></li>
									<li><p>The consumer seeking to increase their credit makes the required payment.</p></li>
									<li><p>The consumer seeking to increase their credit is added as an authorized user to a credit card owned by the credit partner with a good credit who has registered with the company (which could be you). </p></li>
									<li><p>The credit partner gets an email each time a tradeline is sold and spends at least two minutes adding the AU to the card listed according to the instructions in the email.</p></li>
									<li><p>The AU remains on that credit card for two months or more (depending on how much time they need and pay for).</p></li>
									<li><p>The credit partner will receive another email in 2 months informing you of the expiration of the lease period (or of extension of the lease period) and another email instructing you on how to remove the authorized user. </p></li>
									<li><p>The credit partner receives a commission for each authorized user that they add to their credit cards after removing an AU.</p></li>
									</ul>
									<p>In the end, everyone goes home with a big smile on their faces.</p>
									<p>Right now your goal after hearing this may be to earn as much money as possible selling tradelines and just to look for the companies with the highest commissions. </p>
									<p>However, while it may seem easy from the surface, there is a whole lot more to it than just that. It&#x2019;s also important to know the industry well enough and let that knowledge guide your decisions. </p>

						            <h4 class="mt-2">&#x201C;Selling Tradelines, A $1,000 Per Hour Side Gig&#x201D;……..HowTrue?</h4>
						            <p>Technically, this statement is true. </p>
									<p>Selling tradelines can be your new four-digit hourly wage, and this is because it takes such a little amount of time to work out this gig. From a few seconds to a few minutes, then a few clicks of the mouse, and you&#x2019;ve either added or removed AUs to and/or from your account.</p>
									<p>The bulk of the work lies in authenticating tradeline broker companies before registering with them.</p>
									<p>Let&#x2019;s now examine the technicalities, however, to get a better understanding of how that figure works and what it takes to make that much money selling tradelines.</p>
									<p>A most pivotal principle to remember is that how much commission you can earn per credit card is determined by:</p>
									<ul>
									<li><p>The age of the card;</p></li>
									<li><p>The credit limit available on the card.</p></li>
									</ul>
									<p>You earn higher commissions the older the credit card is and the higher the credit limit on the card. </p>
									<p>The range for commissions per AU spot sold generally lies between $50 – $350, depending on the variables given above. So an average would fall say around $150 for mid-limit cards. If it takes you to say 5 minutes to both add and/or remove an AU, that can amount to up to and even above the $1000 mark.</p>
									<p>Now it&#x2019;s impossible to sit for an hour at a stretch and just keep adding and removing AUs; hey, you&#x2019;re gonna get banned! Plus, that one hour spreads out over months or even a year.</p>
									<p>What we are saying is this. With a turnover of two AU spots sold per credit card every two months, one could easily spend just 2.5 minutes working per slot to make $150 per slot. You will need to spend just about 18 minutes and sell just seven slots to make a little over $1000. Wait, that&#x2019;s not even up to an hour in total at the computer yet! And wait, that&#x2019;s even just one card! </p>
									<p>So what if you had more cards? And what if you had older cards? And what if you had higher limit cards? The possibilities are endless!</p>

						            <h4 class="mt-2">Risks With Selling Tradelines</h4>
						            <p>The highest risk? Your credit card could get shut down. A closure could be triggered from the bank considering the number of authorized user (AU) spots you've sold within a given time.</p>
									<p>Selling tradelines is perfectly safe and completely legal. However, you must guard against being greedy which could lead you to add and/or remove too many AUs too quickly. The banks will notice this kind of erratic behavior. </p>
									<p>Your end goal should be to maintain decorum and keep your accounts open, to stay in the game for the long haul. You could even decide to pause your seller's account in between sales, just to give your cards a rest. </p>
									<p>At Credit Rental, we usually only allow you to sell two AU spots per credit card at a time. There are occasional exceptions to this rule based on our discretion and better judgment, but this rule is in place to minimize the risk of getting your card shut down. </p>
						        </div>
						        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="messages1">
						            <h4 class="mt-2">Verifying Your Customers Identities</h4>
						           <p>The steps we take at Credit Rental to minimize the risk of card closures and incidence of fraud are quite intensive and advanced.</p>
									<p>We validate customers&#x2019; identities and mitigate fraud using Lexis Nexis. So, of course, this confirms that our company itself must have undergone a thorough inspection and extensive investigation to be verified and approved by Lexis Nexis.</p>
									<p>Another layer of security filter besides Lexis Nexis is our requirement that color copies of every client&#x2019;s and social security card and driver&#x2019;s license be provided, including all of their personal information such as their address, phone number, email, date of birth, and so on. </p>

						            <h4 class="mt-2">Choosing A Tradeline Company To Work With </h4>
						            <p>Below are some telltale signs that you shouldn't be in partnership with a particular company for selling authorized user tradelines.</p>

									<h3>How often do they allow you to add and remove AUs?</h3>
									<p>If they offer not to put a cap on the number of AUs you can add to a card or frequently you can add and remove AUs to and from one card, then they don't care what happens to you or your card.</p>
									<p>The fact that they permit this kind of unrestrained behavior goes to show that they only want to sign up as many credit partners as they can to replace the inventory, as this helps them make as much money as possible and as quickly as possible, at the expense of the precious credit cards which you have worked so hard and so long to build. </p>

									<h3>Do they sell primaries?</h3>
									<p>Primary tradelines should NOT be for sale! Why you ask?</p>
									<p>A primary tradeline is a pre-existing line of credit that belongs to someone who has worked diligently to build, establish and maintain the untainted history of that card. </p>
									<p>It is insane to assume that any company can sell you the full rights to a primary tradeline. That would be an attempt at fraudulent misrepresentation, an act punishable by law!</p>

									<h3>Do they offer to sell CPNs?  </h3>
									<p>A credit profile number (CPN) is a fake social security number, usually stolen from someone else. This is also a gross misrepresentation and is, therefore, illegal.</p>
